##  Pro Tips for Beginners

### Script Structure
- **Start with 1 activity, 2-3 steps** - keep it simple
- **Use clear, action-oriented names** - "Hit 10 drivers" not "Driver step"
- **Write helpful messages** - explain what the user should do

### Success Criteria
- **Be specific but achievable** - "5 successful shots" not "perfect shots"
- **Allow retries** - learning is iterative
- **Provide clear feedback** - use end messages to explain results

### UI Configuration
- **Show relevant parameters only** - don't overwhelm users
- **Use consistent layouts** - similar steps should look similar
- **Test on actual devices** - what works on desktop may differ on tablets

##  Common Mistakes to Avoid

###  Don't Do This
- Create too many activities at once
- Use vague names like "Step 1", "Step 2"
- Set impossible success criteria
- Skip intro messages
- Forget to validate before saving

###  Do This Instead
- Start with 1-2 activities, add more later
- Use descriptive names like "Driver Accuracy Challenge"
- Set achievable but meaningful goals
- Write clear, encouraging messages
- Always check the green validation checkmark
