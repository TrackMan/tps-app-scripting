## üèóÔ∏è Planning Your Script

### 1. Define Your Training Objectives

Before opening the editor, clearly define:

- **Target Audience**: Beginners, intermediate, or advanced players?
- **Training Goals**: Technical improvement, skill assessment, or competitive challenge?
- **Session Duration**: How long should the complete script take?
- **Success Metrics**: How will you measure training effectiveness?

### 2. Map Your Script Structure

Plan your activities and steps:

```
Training Script Structure Planning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Opening Activity (Warm-up/Assessment)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core Training Activities (2-4 main sections)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge/Application Activity  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Closing Activity (Summary/Next steps)
```

### 3. Choose Activity Types

| Activity Type | Best For | Key Features |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **Range Analysis** | Technical improvement, swing mechanics, data analysis | Detailed shot parameters, swing analysis tools |
| **Performance Center** | Game scenarios, skills challenges, competitive training | Target-based training, scoring systems |

## üéØ Building Range Analysis Scripts

### Step 1: Create the Foundation Activity

1. **Click "‚ûï Add Activity"**
2. **Select "Range Analysis Activity"**
3. **Configure Basic Properties**:
   ```
   Name: "Swing Fundamentals Assessment"
   Intro Message: "Welcome! We'll analyze your swing mechanics to identify areas for improvement."
   End Message: "Great work! Review your data and focus on the highlighted areas in your next practice session."
   ```

## üèåÔ∏è Building Performance Center Scripts

### Step 1: Create Game-Based Activity

1. **Click "‚ûï Add Activity"**
2. **Select "Performance Center Activity"**
3. **Configure for challenge-based training**:
   ```
   Name: "Target Accuracy Challenge"
   Intro Message: "Test your accuracy with various clubs and targets. Score points based on proximity to target."
   End Message: "Challenge complete! Your accuracy score: [will be calculated]. Focus on consistent setup for better results."
   ```

### Step 2: Add Skill-Based Steps

#### Approach Shot Challenge
1. **Add step with competitive element**:
   ```
   Name: "Approach Shot Accuracy"
   Intro Message: "Hit 6 approach shots to the flagstick. Points awarded based on distance from target."
   ```

2. **Configure competitive logic**:
   ```
   Success Condition:

   - 20-30 feet: 5 points
   - Beyond 30 feet: 2 points
   ```

#### Short Game Precision
1. **Add specialized short game step**:
   ```
   Name: "Chipping Precision Test"
   Intro Message: "Chip 8 balls to different targets around the green. Vary your club selection and technique."
   ```

2. **Configure for multiple targets**:
   ```
   Success Condition:
   - Shots Required: 8
   - Conditions: Hit at least 6 targets within acceptable range
   
   Challenge Elements:
   - 4 different target distances
   - 2 shots to each target

   ```

### Step 3: Configure Performance UI

1. **Select your approach shot step**
2. **Choose Performance Center parameters**:
   - ‚úÖ Distance to Target
   - ‚úÖ Shot Accuracy Score
   - ‚úÖ Trajectory Height
   - ‚úÖ Landing Angle

3. **Add competitive frame actions**:
   ```
   Action 1: "View Score"
   - Shows current points total
   - Updates after each shot
   
   Action 2: "Leaderboard"
   - Compare with previous attempts
   - Motivational element
   
   Action 3: "Next Challenge"
   - Proceeds when criteria met
   - Maintains momentum
   ```

## üîÑ Advanced Workflow Techniques

### Creating Progressive Difficulty

Structure your activities to build skill progressively:

```
Activity 1: Foundation Building
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Step 1: Basic technique (easy success criteria)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Step 2: Consistency focus (moderate criteria)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Step 3: Precision requirement (challenging criteria)

Activity 2: Skill Application  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Step 1: Combine techniques learned
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Step 2: Add pressure/time elements
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Step 3: Game-situation simulation
```

### Implementing Adaptive Pathways

Use logic conditions to create different paths:

```
Main Path: Standard progression for most users
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Success ‚Üí Next Activity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Partial Success ‚Üí Remedial Step ‚Üí Continue
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Failure ‚Üí Alternative Approach ‚Üí Rejoin Main Path
```

**Implementation Example**:
1. **Set primary success condition** (e.g., 8/10 successful shots)
2. **Add partial success condition** (e.g., 5-7 successful shots)
3. **Create branching logic**:
   - Full success: Skip to next activity
   - Partial success: Additional practice step
   - Failure: Technique review step

### Multi-Activity Script Structure

For comprehensive training sessions:

```
Complete Training Session (45-60 minutes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üî• Warm-up Activity (5-10 minutes)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Easy swings step
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Basic target step
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìä Assessment Activity (10-15 minutes)  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current skill evaluation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Weakness identification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üéØ Focused Training Activity (20-25 minutes)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Primary skill development
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Technique refinement  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Consistency building
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üèÜ Challenge Activity (10-15 minutes)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Apply new skills
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Competitive element
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù Summary Activity (5 minutes)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Results review and next steps
```

## üé® Message Writing Best Practices

### Intro Messages

**Structure**: Context + Task + Encouragement

```
‚ùå Poor Example:
"Hit some balls with your driver."

‚úÖ Good Example:  
"Now let's work on your driver consistency. Hit 8-10 tee shots focusing on your setup and tempo. Don't worry about distance - focus on solid contact and good balance through impact."
```

### End Messages

**Structure**: Acknowledgment + Results + Next Steps

```
‚ùå Poor Example:
"Step completed."

‚úÖ Good Example:
"Excellent work! You achieved 85% accuracy with your approach shots. Your distance control has improved significantly. Next, we'll work on different lies and course conditions to further develop your skills."
```

### Contextual Messaging

Provide appropriate context for different situations:

```
First-time users: More explanation and encouragement
Returning users: Reference previous sessions and improvement
Advanced users: Technical details and competitive elements
Struggling users: Positive reinforcement and simplified goals
```

## üí° Pro Tips and Advanced Techniques

### Creating Memorable Experiences

1. **Tell a story** - frame training as a journey or challenge
2. **Use progressive revelation** - introduce concepts gradually
3. **Celebrate achievements** - acknowledge progress at each step
4. **Provide choice** - let users select their focus areas when possible

### Technical Optimization

1. **Minimize required parameters** - only show what adds value
2. **Group related steps** - maintain flow and context
3. **Use consistent language** - same terms throughout the script
4. **Design for interruption** - scripts should handle pauses gracefully

### User Experience Excellence

1. **Front-load instructions** - explain everything upfront
2. **Provide escape hatches** - allow users to skip if needed
3. **Show progress** - users want to know how much is left
4. **End on a high note** - finish with success and encouragement
