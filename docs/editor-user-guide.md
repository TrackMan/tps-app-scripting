- What logic or calculations are required?

### Step 2: Add Activities
1. Drag an **Input** activity from the Activities Panel to the canvas
2. Place it between the Start and End activities
3. Click on the Input activity to select it
4. In the Properties Panel, set:
   - **Name**: "Get User Name"
   - **Prompt**: "Please enter your name:"
   - **Variable**: "userName"

### Step 3: Connect Activities
1. Click on the Start activity
2. In Properties Panel, set **Next** to the ID of your Input activity
3. Click on the Input activity
4. Set its **Next** to "end"

### Step 4: Add Output
1. Drag an **Output** activity between Input and End
2. Configure it to display a greeting
3. Set **Message** to: "Hello, {{userName}}!"
4. Update the Input activity's **Next** to point to this Output activity
5. Set Output activity's **Next** to "end"

### Step 5: Test Your Script
1. Click the **Run** button in the toolbar
2. Enter a name when prompted
3. Verify the greeting displays correctly
4. Check the Debug Panel for any issues

### Configuring Activities
Each activity has specific properties:

#### Common Properties (All Activities)

- **Required** - Whether input is mandatory
- **Default Value** - Pre-filled value

#### Output Activity Properties
- **Message** - Text to display
- **Format** - Display format (plain text, HTML, markdown)
- **Style** - Visual styling options

#### Condition Activity Properties
- **Condition** - Boolean expression to evaluate
- **True Next** - Activity to execute if condition is true
- **False Next** - Activity to execute if condition is false

### Deleting Activities
1. Select the activity on the canvas
2. Press the Delete key, or
3. Right-click and select "Delete"
4. Confirm the deletion

## Managing Variables

### Variable Basics
Variables store data that can be used throughout your script. They are created when first assigned a value and can be referenced in other activities.

### Variable Naming Rules
- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case sensitive (userName ≠ username)
- No spaces or special characters
- Should be descriptive (prefer "customerAge" over "x")

### Data Types
- **String** - Text values ("Hello", "123 Main St")
- **Number** - Numeric values (42, 3.14, -17)
- **Boolean** - True/false values
- **Array** - Lists of values ([1, 2, 3] or ["red", "green", "blue"])
- **Object** - Complex structures ({name: "John", age: 30})

### Using Variables
Reference variables in properties using double curly braces:
- `{{variableName}}` - Insert variable value
- `{{user.name}}` - Access object properties
- `{{items[0]}}` - Access array elements

### Variable Operations
- **Assignment** - Set variable values
- **Concatenation** - Combine strings: `{{firstName}} {{lastName}}`
- **Calculations** - Mathematical operations: `{{price * quantity}}`
- **Comparisons** - Boolean expressions: `{{age >= 18}}`

## Script Flow Control

### Linear Flow
Simple scripts execute activities in sequence:
Start → Activity1 → Activity2 → Activity3 → End

### Conditional Flow
Use Condition activities to create branches:
```
Start → Input → Condition
                    ├─ True → Activity A → End
                    └─ False → Activity B → End
```

### Loops
Repeat activities using Loop activities:
- **For Loop** - Repeat a specific number of times
- **While Loop** - Repeat while condition is true
- **For Each Loop** - Iterate over array elements

### Complex Flows
Combine conditions and loops for sophisticated logic:
- Nested conditions (conditions within conditions)
- Loops with conditions inside
- Multiple paths converging to common activities

## Testing and Debugging

### Running Scripts
1. Click the **Run** button or press F5
2. Follow prompts and provide required input
3. Observe output and behavior
4. Check the Debug Panel for detailed information

### Debug Panel Features
- **Execution Log** - Step-by-step activity execution
- **Variable Inspection** - Current values of all variables
- **Error Messages** - Detailed error information
- **Performance Metrics** - Execution time and resource usage

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Activity not found" Error
- Check that all "next" references point to valid activity IDs
- Verify activity IDs are spelled correctly
- Ensure no typos in activity connections

#### Variables Not Working
- Confirm variable names are consistent throughout the script
- Check that variables are created before they're used
- Verify variable syntax uses double curly braces: `{{variableName}}`

#### Script Doesn't End
- Ensure there's a path from every activity to an End activity
- Check for infinite loops in your logic
- Verify conditional branches both lead to termination

#### Unexpected Behavior
- Review activity properties for correct configuration
- Test with different input values
- Use the Debug Panel to trace execution flow
