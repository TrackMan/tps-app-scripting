   - Use progressive disclosure for complex training
   - Group related parameters together

2. **Check Display Settings**
   - Reset browser zoom to 100%
   - Try different screen resolution if possible
   - Test on target TrackMan hardware

#### Poor Readability
```
Problem: Text too small, colors hard to see, poor contrast
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Simplify Display**
   - Reduce number of displayed parameters
   - Use larger, clearer fonts
   - Increase contrast between text and background

2. **Test in Real Environment**
   - Check visibility from hitting position
   - Consider lighting conditions in facility
   - Test with actual TrackMan system display
