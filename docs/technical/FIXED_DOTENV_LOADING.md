# ✅ Fixed: Server Now Loads .env File!

## What Was Wrong

The server wasn't loading environment variables from the `server/.env` file because:
- ❌ `ts-node-dev` doesn't automatically load `.env` files
- ❌ No `dotenv` package was installed
- ❌ No code to load the `.env` file

Result: `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` was never read, even though it was in the file!

## What I Fixed

1. ✅ Added `dotenv` package to `server/package.json`
2. ✅ Added code to load `.env` at server startup in `server/src/index.ts`
3. ✅ Installed the package with `npm install`

## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Restart the Server

In your server terminal (or start a new one):

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Look for the Success Message

You should now see:

```
✅ Azure Table Storage connected: WebhookEvents
```

Instead of:

```
⚠️  AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING not set. Table Storage disabled.
```

### Step 3: Test It

```powershell
# Test the webhook endpoint
curl http://localhost:4000/api/webhook/39a1ebb6-c429-4e01-b83d-8774a4573a1f/events
```

Should return:

```json
{
  "count": X,
  "events": [...],
  "source": "memory+storage",
  "storageEnabled": true  ← This should be true now!
}
```

### Step 4: Test in Browser

1. Open http://localhost:5000
2. Login and select a bay
3. Go to **Webhook** tab
4. **You should now see events from Azure Storage!** 🎉

## Quick Test Command

```powershell
.\scripts\test-webhook-integration.ps1
```

This time all tests should pass!

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `server/src/index.ts` - Added dotenv.config()
2. ✅ `server/package.json` - Added dotenv dependency
3. ✅ Ran `npm install` in server directory

## Why This Happened

You had **TWO `.env` files**:

1. **Root `.env`** - For frontend (Vite) - Uses `VITE_` prefix
2. **`server/.env`** - For backend (Node.js) - Plain variable names

You correctly added the connection string to `server/.env`, but the server code wasn't configured to load it!

Now it is! 🚀
