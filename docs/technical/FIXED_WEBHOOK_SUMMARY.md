#  Fixed: Webhook Tab Now Works Locally!

## What Was Wrong

Your localhost wasn't showing webhook events because:

1.  Frontend was configured with `VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://dr-cloud-api-dev.trackmangolfdev.com`
2.  WebhookView component used this URL directly, bypassing the Vite proxy
3.  Requests went to cloud backend instead of your local server
4.  Local server (with Azure Storage connection) was being ignored

## What I Fixed

###  Code Change: `src/components/WebhookView.tsx`

Added automatic localhost detection:

```typescript
// Detect if running on localhost to use Vite proxy
const isLocalhost = windowOrigin.includes('localhost') || windowOrigin.includes('127.0.0.1');
const normalizedBase = isLocalhost ? '' : String(viteEnvBase || windowOrigin || '').replace(/\/$/, '');
```

**How it works:**
- **On localhost** (http://localhost:5000): Uses relative URLs → Goes through Vite proxy → Your local server
- **On cloud** (https://...): Uses `VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL` → Direct to cloud backend

###  Now Your Setup Works Like This:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Frontend (localhost:5000)                       │
│  ↓                                               │
│  WebhookView detects localhost                 │
│  ↓                                               │
│  Uses relative URL: /api/webhook/...            │
│  ↓                                               │
│  Vite Proxy (configured in vite.config.ts)      │
│  ↓                                               │
│  Forwards to: localhost:4000/api/webhook/...    │
│  ↓                                               │
│  Local Server (with Azure Storage connection)   │
│  ↓                                               │
│  Reads from Azure Table Storage                 │
│  ↓                                               │
│  Returns ALL events (same as cloud!)          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Frontend (to pick up code changes)

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Verify Configuration

```powershell
.\scripts\test-webhook-integration.ps1
```

This will check:
-  Local server running
-  Azure Storage connected
-  Vite proxy working
-  Events accessible

### Step 3: Test in Browser

1. Open http://localhost:5000 (or your port)
2. Login
3. Select a bay
4. Go to **Webhook** tab
5. **You should now see events!** 

### Step 4: Verify Network Request

Open DevTools → Network tab:
-  Request should be: `http://localhost:5000/api/webhook/YOUR_PATH/events`
-  Should NOT be: `https://dr-cloud-api-dev.trackmangolfdev.com/...`

## What This Means

###  Benefits

1. **Same data everywhere**: Local dev sees the same events as cloud
2. **No config changes needed**: Works automatically when on localhost
3. **No .env changes**: Can keep `VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL` set to cloud
4. **Team-friendly**: Other developers get the same experience
5. **Deployment-ready**: Code works correctly in both environments

###  Comparison

**Before (Not Working):**
```
localhost:5000 → cloud backend → cloud storage 
```

**After (Working):**
```
localhost:5000 → proxy → localhost:4000 → Azure Storage 
```

## Files Modified

1.  `src/components/WebhookView.tsx` - Auto-detect localhost
2.  `server/.env` - Has Azure Storage connection string

## Files Created (Documentation)

1.  `WEBHOOK_LOCAL_FIX.md` - Detailed explanation
2.  `scripts/test-webhook-integration.ps1` - Test script
3.  `FIXED_WEBHOOK_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Troubleshooting

### Still Not Seeing Events?

**Check 1: Is server running?**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Look for:
```
 Azure Table Storage connected: WebhookEvents
```

**Check 2: Is connection string configured?**
```powershell
.\scripts\verify-local-storage.ps1
```

**Check 3: Are there events in storage?**
The events must have been sent to your webhook URL in Azure. If you haven't set up the webhook subscription yet, there won't be any events to display.

**Check 4: Is frontend using proxy?**
Open DevTools → Network tab → Look for `/api/webhook/` requests
- Should go to `localhost:5000/api/...` (which proxies to `:4000`)
- Should NOT go directly to `dr-cloud-api-dev.trackmangolfdev.com`

### How to Verify Proxy is Working

```bash
# With server running on :4000 and frontend on :5000
curl http://localhost:5000/api/webhook/YOUR_PATH/events
```

Should return events from your local server.

## Next Steps

1.  Code fix applied
2.  Restart frontend (`npm run dev`)
3.  Run test script (`.\scripts\test-webhook-integration.ps1`)
4.  Open http://localhost:5000 → Webhook tab
5.  See your events!

## Need More Help?

-  Read: `WEBHOOK_LOCAL_FIX.md` for detailed options
-  Read: `LOCAL_AZURE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` for storage setup
-  Run: `.\scripts\test-webhook-integration.ps1` for diagnostics
-  Run: `.\scripts\verify-local-storage.ps1` for config check

**The fix is automatic!** Just restart your frontend and it should work.
